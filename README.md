iStore
======

iStore as created Fall 2011 for Clemson University. Ability to run on modern systems not guaranteed. Reference Only.

iStore is a suite of iOS App prototypes that enabled a retail store to create a live map of their store shelves and then stock these shelves with items so that customers could use a companion app to easily find items in an unfamiliar store.

Client App is under the Client branch, Commercial App is under the Commercial branch. Within this main branch are the documents and other details explaining this app.

 My (Ryan Britt) major contribution was to overall design and commercial app.
